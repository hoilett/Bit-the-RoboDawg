Changing naming conventions. The light source will be known as BitBeacon and
the photodiode circuit will be the BitReceptor.

Added a non-inverting amplifier to BitBeacon to get a higher peak-to-peak
emission from ~5V-4.2V to 1.3V-0.96V for about 3V-3.5V peak-to-peak. Now
using 3 IR LEDs (SFH 4545) and a 6.8 kOhm base resistor. But also swap between
5.6 kOhm to 8.2 kOhm. Average current through each LED is on the order of
33 mA.

Moved C3 from ground to 5V. It appears to make the sine wave generator
much more stable.

Moved back to using if/else if/else statements to determine the direction.
This is a change from writing sensor intensity values directly to the motors
with analogWrite. Using if statements appears to be more fluid. The other
method mentioned needs more work.
