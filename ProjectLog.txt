Tested Bit outside. It appears the BitBeacon stops operating outside. Not sure why. Will need to change BitBeacon circuit. I’m thinking a square wave oscillator to a square to sine wave filter.

Taking around BME: May need to decrease the light intensity a bit more. Still having trouble differentiating between north and northwest/northeast. Maybe use one less LED to narrow the BitBeacon beam width. Or decrease the buffer zone in the code that delineates north from northwest or northeast.

Maybe if Bit could detect when it’s in a room and act appropriately.

I still have to more or less direct the IR lights. It’s not ready for just staying on my back and having Bit follow.

Also, for clearing doors. Maybe if Bit could detect that there is a door open maybe a command “Come through the door.” Then if Bit could determine the best route to take to come through the door and start following the Beacon after that.

Or maybe, when I get into a room and don’t have enough clearance for the light sensors, Bit can switch modes for follow-me. Maybe at that point, it could use the ultrasonic distance sensors.

I definitely need a fuel gauge on Bit to monitor battery voltage and maybe battery voltage vs. performance because I definitely see a difference in performance when the battery is low.

Shift in baseline — may need to re-baseline after(during) long periods of inactivity.
Also optimize frequency of the BitBeacon with the response time of Bit, the sampling frequency of analogRead(), and the sampling frequency of the baseline period.

Updated comments and descriptions for Version 0.1.0. of BitController.

I noticed that with using Bit indoors in BME, that the light intensity probably doesn’t need to be very high. I also noticed that as Bit gets closer to the Beacon, the light intensity should decrease as to decrease the cross-talk between north, east, and west on the BitReceptor. Maybe there should be a feedback between the Beacon and the Receptor to decrease light intensity when Bit gets closer to the BitBeacon.

Bit also needs an obstacle avoiding mechanism.

Changing naming conventions. The light source will be known as BitBeacon and
the photodiode circuit will be the BitReceptor.

Added a non-inverting amplifier to BitBeacon to get a higher peak-to-peak
emission from ~5V-4.2V to 1.3V-0.96V for about 3V-3.5V peak-to-peak. Now
using 3 IR LEDs (SFH 4545) and a 6.8 kOhm base resistor. But also swap between
5.6 kOhm to 8.2 kOhm. Average current through each LED is on the order of
33 mA.

Moved C3 from ground to 5V. It appears to make the sine wave generator
much more stable.

Moved back to using if/else if/else statements to determine the direction.
This is a change from writing sensor intensity values directly to the motors
with analogWrite. Using if statements appears to be more fluid. The other
method mentioned needs more work.
