- Use the photosensor circuit (BitBeacon) to control movement towards the person holding the emitter.
- BitEmitter is a sine wave signal > 120 Hz probably 1.5 kHz at least one decade higher 120 Hz.
- Bit will proceed in the direction of the highest intensity (north, south, east, west) with gradations in between.


Use the nRF24L01 to do fancy movements
The nRF24L01 modules will override the BitBeacon circuit
